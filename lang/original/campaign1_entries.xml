      <S1result>Waltham Animal Park Redevelopment Successful!</S1result>
      <S1overview>
         MSPA officials have found conditions in the Waltham Animal Park to be in violation of animal 
         welfare standards. Exhibits are filthy, animals are underfed and in environments that aren't meeting their needs, and trash litters the public areas. They have ordered that the park be closed. 
         <p/>
         The Blue Fang Development Fund has acquired $10,000 to contribute to the redevelopment and future 
         growth of the site. MSPA concedes that improving conditions is in the best interests of the 
         animals and has given you an agenda: Hire maintenance staff to clean the park and zookeepers 
         to address the exhibits. Ensure that the basic needs of the animals currently in the park are met. Once you've achieved these objectives, MSPA will review your efforts.

	MSPA officials are pleased with your progress on the cleanup effort and have lifted the 
	restrictions on opening the park. You can now open your park to the public and begin 
	earning park revenue to supplement the redevelopment effort. Enhance the existing exhibits to make them more visually appealing to the guests and place donation boxes to collect revenue.
         <p/>     	
	MSPA officials have also granted permission to create one new exhibit to allow them to judge your 
	abilities to grow the park. Create a new animal exhibit to help increase park popularity and 
	demonstrate that you can adequately care for the animal by meeting the advanced privacy needs 
	of all your animals. Purchasing appropriate shelters will help the animals' attempts to meet their 
	privacy needs. The Blue Fang Development Fund has acquired an additional $5,000 to aid you in 
	your effort.

      <S3overview>    
	Word of the Blue Fang Development Fund has spread and administrators have been notified of a facility 
	in severe need of help. The Raintree Cooperative Animal Park is a new facility with the best 
	intentions, but unfortunately, their zoo planners did not understand the needs of their animals. Exhibits 
	are cramped and unsuitable for the animals' habitat needs. You have been granted $5,000 to improve the 
	exhibit conditions for the animals at the park. 
         <p/>   
	The zoo has been closed due to the poor condition of the exhibits. You have the option of re-opening the zoo at any time should you require additional 
	funds. However, guests do not enjoy viewing unhappy animals. No new animals may be added to the park until the environment
	is made suitable for the existing animals.

      <S4overview>
      	An expert panel has criticized your park's handling of animals, citing several critical illnesses that have plagued animals in your facility. As a result of this unwanted attention, all of your zookeepers 
      	have quit!  You must hire new zookeepers and restore your animals to good health before things get even 
      	more out of control. 
         <p/>   
	At the moment, hunger and illness run rampant through the facility. Although the Blue Fang Development Fund 
	has been able to contribute $5,000 towards your efforts, your funds remain limited as there 
	was no allowance in your annual budget for this sort of emergency. You must continue to generate 
	admissions income to be able to hire a sufficient staff. As guests do not enjoy seeing ill animals, 
	it is recommended that you build a quarantine area to isolate the ill animals. 
         <p/>  
	Restore your animals to good condition so that a press conference can put to rest the rumors circulating 
	about your facility.
