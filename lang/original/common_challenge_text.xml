      <CHInstantChallengeWelcome>Welcome to challenge mode! When you successfully complete a challenge, you earn cash or other rewards. However, if you fail a challenge, there may be negative consequences for your zoo, such as money penalties or a decline in guest attendance. All challenges are optional, so if you're not interested in one, just decline it.</CHInstantChallengeWelcome>
