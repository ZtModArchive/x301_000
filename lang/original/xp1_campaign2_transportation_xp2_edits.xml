      <GreatSavannahGiantSableAntelope>
A survey of your guests reveals that they're extremely interested in seeing the critically endangered giant sable antelope in its native savannah habitat. If you can obtain two giant sable antelope and meet their needs within the next month, guest attendance at your zoo will increase! (Note: This is an optional goal. Failing to complete it will not cause you to fail the scenario.)
