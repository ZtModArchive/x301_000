Use sky trams and elevated paths to showcase savannah wildlife! Build a successful zoo without disturbing a protected conservation area. Complete all of the scenarios in this campaign to unlock the decorated tour gate.  
      </GreatSavannahOverviewShort>
      <GreatSavannahOverview>
Decades of poaching have greatly reduced wildlife populations in the local savannah. To help stop the problem, the authorities have designated a large section of savannah as a protected conservation area. 
      <p/>
Your job is to build a successful zoo and wildlife park around the protected area. The conservation area itself is off limits to most forms of development. You may, however, build elevated paths and sky trams over the conservation area. You may also place animals inside the conservation area. Adopting savannah animals and placing them on exhibit in the conservation area helps rebuild the local animal populations while teaching the public about the savannah ecosystem at the same time.
      <p/>
The local authorities want the new zoo and wildlife park you're creating to be a state-of-art facility. They want you to build a working sky tram system in your zoo with at least two stations. In return they will give you a $8,000 grant. (Hint: Increase your zoo fame to 2 stars first.)    
      </GreatSavannahOverview>
      <GreatSavannahFame>
Good work! Your park now contains a working sky tram system. You've been given a $8,000 grant to help with the costs.
      <p/>
The local authorities are eager for you to build the zoo into a world-class institution. If you can increase your zoo fame to 4 stars, you'll prove that it's possible to create a popular zoo around a protected conservation area. Get your zoo fame to 4 stars to win the scenario!

      <GreatSavannahGiantSableAntelope>
A survey of your guests reveals that they're extremely interested in seeing the critically endangered giant sable antelope in its native savannah habitat. If you can obtain two giant sable antelope and meet their basic needs within the next month, guest attendance at your zoo will increase! (Note: This is an optional goal. Failing to complete it will not cause you to fail the scenario.) 
      </GreatSavannahGiantSableAntelope>
      <GreatSavannahGiantSableAntelopeSuccess>
You've obtained two giant sable antelope and met their basic needs. Guests are eager to see these rare and fascinating creatures living in their native savannah environment. The animals have attracted a wave of new guests to your zoo! 
      </GreatSavannahGiantSableAntelopeSuccess>
      <GreatSavannahGiantSableAntelopeFailureNoAntelope>
A month has gone by and you still haven't obtained a pair of giant sable antelope. Interest in seeing the animals has declined. You have missed your chance to attract extra guests to your zoo.
      </GreatSavannahGiantSableAntelopeFailureNoAntelope>
      <GreatSavannahGiantSableAntelopeFailureNeed>
Although you have obtained two giant sable antelope, you have failed to meet their basic needs. Guests aren't interested in seeing animals that are unhappy or poorly cared for. You have missed your chance to attract extra guests to your zoo.

      <BridgingGapIntro>Bridging the Gap</BridgingGapIntro>
      <BridgingGapOverviewShort>Can you build a zoo that contains 16 different animal species? There's only one catch--there's a chasm in your way! Complete all of the scenarios in this campaign to unlock the decorated tour gate.
      </BridgingGapOverviewShort>
      <BridgingGapOverview>The owners of the local zoo have ambitious plans to expand their small facility. The only problem is that the zoo is built next to a deep chasm, and local environmental laws prohibit any construction that might damage the chasm's delicate ecosystem. 
      <p/>
      You've been hired to solve the owner's expansion problem using modern tranportation technologies. Your first goal is to expand the zoo so that there are at least eight species of animal on display. When you achieve that goal, the owners will pay you a $4,000 bonus.
      </BridgingGapOverview>
      <BridgingGapTwelve>
      The owners are very happy to see eight different species on display in the zoo, so they have given you a $4,000 bonus as a reward. Now they want to expand even more. Increase the number of species on display to 12 and the owners will pay you a $10,000 bonus!
      </BridgingGapTwelve>
      <BridgingGapSixteen>
      The owners are impressed that you've managed to display 12 different species. They've given you $10,000 in recognition of your efforts. However, they feel that one more expansion will really establish their zoo as a leading facility. Increase the number of different species on display to 16 to win the scenario!
      </BridgingGapSixteen>      
      <BridgingGapSuccessOverview>
      Congratulations! You've overcome geographical obstacles and transformed a small zoo into one that contains 16 different species. The owners are delighted!

      <p/>

		The board has given you two goals. First, create a tour with a 4-star tour rating within one year. You may use either Jeep&#xAE; vehicles or sky trams for your tour. Second, build up your zoo fame to 5 stars within one year. Complete both of these goals by January first of year two to win the scenario!

      <ReachForStarsFailure>It's been a full year since you started, but you haven't managed to meet the board of directors' goals of creating a 4-star tour and a 5-star zoo. The board has decided you're not the right person for the job and has terminated your employment. Better luck next time! 
      </ReachForStarsFailure>
