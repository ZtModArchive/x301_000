             Captive breeding is a strong indication of a zoo's ongoing commitment to wildlife conservation. The major donors backing your zoo are so committed to conservation that they have put a restriction on your ability to adopt animals from other facilities. They insist that you develop an active, thriving breeding and adoption program so that you can offer animals to other facilities.

             Meet the advanced needs of your animals to encourage reproduction. Don't let your animals become too crowded in their exhibits. Put extra animals up for adoption to other facilities, but make sure you keep enough breeding stock to maintain a growing and thriving animal community.

             You will receive an adoption fee for each animal adopted by another facility. You can use the funds raised through the adoption to do a better job of providing special diets, animal enrichment toys, and comfortable homes for your animals.

      <VulnerableAnimalsSuccessoverview>Your breeding program has successfully added to the world's vulnerable animal population. There have been enough births to place your animals for adoption with other facilities. By doing so, you have contributed to the conservation of these important animals.      </VulnerableAnimalsSuccessoverview>
      <VulnerableAnimalsFailureoverview>Oh no! You only have one %s! You have neglected to keep enough mixed gender animals to maintain a breeding program. Unfortunately, you have no way to breed your animals to support any sort of adoption drive. Contrary to the wishes of your zoo's major donors, you have no choice now but to adopt additional animals.      </VulnerableAnimalsFailureoverview>
      <VulnerableAnimalsresult>Animal Adoption program a success!</VulnerableAnimalsresult>
      <VulnerableAnimalsBreeding> Breed your animals and offer extra animals for adoption. You must offer one of each of the four species for adoption, but be sure to keep a male and female of each species in your zoo.      </VulnerableAnimalsBreeding>
      <VulnerableAnimalsBreedingone> You have successfully placed one animal for adoption!      </VulnerableAnimalsBreedingone>

             The birth of any baby animal is a momentous occasion, but the captive breeding of an endangered species is an important, proactive way to ensure species survival.
