      <MeerkatsIntro>A Mob of Meerkats</MeerkatsIntro>
      <MeerkatsOverview>Your zoo wants to obtain more African animals. A nearby wildlife sanctuary has offered to donate two of their meerkats. There's no charge, but you have promised to take care good care of these small, sociable animals.       
         <p/>
         You will find the two meerkats in crates near the entrance to your zoo. Create an exhibit for the animals and meet all their basic needs. Once you've demonstrated that you can care for the creatures, the wildlife sanctuary may donate additional meerkats to your zoo.
         <p/>
         One thing to note about meerkats is that they are very good diggers. So good, in fact, that they can dig under many types of fences! If you don't have a fence that can keep them in you will either need to be clever when you design their exhibit or just catch them whenever they escape.

It will be a lot for you to handle, but these highly social animals refuse to be separated from each other.
      <p/>The wildlife sanctuary will check on the meerkats in two months. Should you fail to meet the basic needs of any of the meerkats, they will be removed from your zoo and donated to another facility.</MeerkatsPart1SuccessOverview>

      <SecretaryBirdIntro>The Secretary Bird</SecretaryBirdIntro>
      <SecretaryBirdOverviewShort>Can you capture the behaviors of this long-legged predator on film? Complete all of the scenarios in this campaign to unlock desert-themed buildings and objects.</SecretaryBirdOverviewShort>
      <SecretaryBirdOverview>The secretary bird is a common sight in the savannahs and grasslands of Africa. Although these long-legged predators can fly, secretary birds spend most of their time on foot, striding over the landscape in search of lizards, insects, and rodents to feed on.
      <p/>
      The Raptor Protection Society helps protect birds of prey throughout the world. The society has donated a secretary bird to your zoo, which you will find crated near the entrance to your zoo. In exchange for the donation, the society wants you to take a series of secretary bird photos for the annual fundraising calendar. 
      <p/>
      The first two photos the society would like are:
      <br/>
			*  A photo of the secretary bird preening. (Hint: secretary birds preen when their hygiene need is high.)
			<br/>
			*  A photo of the secretary bird flapping its wings.
      </SecretaryBirdOverview>
      
      <SecretaryBirdGuests>The Raptor Protection Society wants to increase public awareness of the secretary bird exhibit at your zoo. If you can attract a grand total of 75 guests to your zoo, the society will give you a $20,000 donation.			
      </SecretaryBirdGuests>
      
      <SecretaryBirdPart1Goals>
      Take the following photos:
      <br/>

			*  A photo of the secretary bird flapping its wings.
      </SecretaryBirdPart1Goals>
      
      <SecretaryBirdPart1GoalsDone>You have taken the first set of secretary bird photos. As a reward for your fine work on the pictures, you have been given a $10,000 bonus!</SecretaryBirdPart1GoalsDone>
      
      <SecretaryBirdBehaviors>The Raptor Protection Society was quite pleased with your first set of photos. Now the society wants you to photograph some of the secretary bird's more advanced behaviors.
      <p/>
      Take the following photos:
      <br/>
			*  A secretary bird using a pursuit ball. (Hint: the pursuit ball is available at 2 stars of zoo fame.)
			<br/>
			*  A secretary bird stalking live lizard food. (Hint: the live lizard food is available at 1 1/2 stars of zoo fame.)
      </SecretaryBirdBehaviors>

      <SecretaryBirdBreed>
      The Raptor Protection Society was once again impressed by your secretary bird photos. The society would like just one more photo for the calendar: a secretary bird egg!
      <p/>
      Of course, before you can take a photo of a secretary bird egg, you'll need to obtain a male secretary bird and then breed your pair. (Hint: To encourage breeding, make sure all of the secretary birds' advanced needs are met.)
      </SecretaryBirdBreed>
      
      <SecretaryBirdSuccessOverview>
Congratulations! Thanks to your photos, the Raptor Protection Society's calendar is sure to raise a lot of money to help protect wild birds of prey.

      <AfricanDiversityIntro>The African Diversity Zoo</AfricanDiversityIntro>
      
      <AfricanDiversityOverview>
You've been hired to build a new zoo that will spotlight the vast diversity of African wildlife. The zoo's board of directors would like you to create a zoo containing at least 14 different species of African animals. Your zoo may contain animals from other areas of the world as well, but they won't count toward your goal.
         <p/>
Since the intention is to spotlight Africa's natural diversity, the board doesn't want you to rely too heavily on traditional savannah species like zebras and lions. So only four of the 14 African species in your zoo can be savannah species!
