      <BairdsTapirOverviewShort>
A local town has built a small zoo around a pair of endangered Baird's tapirs. Can you build a colony of tapirs while raising donations and protecting the tapirs' environment at the same time? Complete all the scenarios in this campaign to unlock the conservation breeding center.

      <BairdsTapirOverview>
A pair of rare Baird's tapirs has been discovered on land belonging to a nearby town. Rather than move the endangered creatures, the town council decided to build a small zoo near their protected habitat. 
         <p/>
The town has already begun work on the zoo and acquired a couple of additional animals to help get you started. Your job is to build a colony of healthy tapirs without disturbing their environment, while raising money for the zoo.
        <p/>
The first thing to do is make sure your tapirs are happy, healthy, and well-fed. Meet the basic needs of all the tapirs in your zoo.       
      </BairdsTapirOverview>
      <BairdsTapirFailure>
One of your tapirs has died! Since caring for the tapirs was your primary responsibility, the town council has regretfully ended your employment at the zoo. You have failed to achieve your goals.
      </BairdsTapirFailure>
      <BairdsTapirDonations>
Your tapirs are doing great! All of their basic needs are being met.
      <p/>
Now that your tapirs are happy and healthy, the town council wants you to get your little zoo on firm financial footing. Raise $3,000 in guest donations to prove that you can attract visitors to your zoo.
      </BairdsTapirDonations>
      <BairdsTapirColony>
Good job! Your zoo has raised more than $3,000 in guest donations. The members of the town council are pleased with your progress.
      <p/>
They are so pleased, in fact, that they have asked you to expand your colony of Baird's tapirs. Make a tapir exhibit containing five or more tapirs to win the scenario!
      <p/>
You can get five tapirs either by breeding the tapirs you have or by adopting new ones. Adoption is fast but expensive. Breeding is extremely slow but free.
      </BairdsTapirColony>
      <BairdsTapirSuccessOverview>
Your Baird's tapir colony is a big success. Now that you have five of them, you're sure this endangered species has a secure future in your area. And the town council is happy with your zoo as well. Congratulations!

      <BreedingProgramIntro>Endangered Species Breeding Program</BreedingProgramIntro>
      
      <BreedingProgramOverviewShort>Help save endangered species by breeding three different endangered animals and then releasing them to the wild. Complete all the scenarios in this campaign to unlock the conservation breeding center.
      </BreedingProgramOverviewShort>
      <BreedingProgramOverview>The board of directors of your zoo has come up with an ambitious breeding program designed to help save endangered species in zoos and in the wild. They want you to acquire and breed three different endangered species, then release one of each species to the wild.
      <p/>
      The endangered species that will be part of your breeding program are the Galapagos giant tortoise, the scimitar horned oryx, and the markhor. The first step is to acquire one of each of the animals and meet their basic needs. (Hint: build your zoo fame to at least 1 star first!)
      </BreedingProgramOverview>
      <BreedingProgramBreed>Good work acquiring the required endangered animals! Now it's time to begin the breeding program. For each species, acquire a second animal of the opposite sex to create a breeding pair. Breed one of each of the following: the Galapagos giant tortoise, the scimitar horned oryx, and the markhor.
      <p/>
      To help you continue the breeding program, the zoo's board of directors has awarded you a $10,000 cash grant.
      </BreedingProgramBreed>
      <BreedingProgramRelease>Well done! You've bred each of the endangered species. Now it's time to help rebuild the populations of these species in their native habitats. Release one Galapagos giant tortoise, one scimitar horned oryx, and one markhor to the wild.
      </BreedingProgramRelease>      
      <BreedingProgramSuccessOverview>
      Your breeding program is complete! In addition to breeding these endangered species, you've also helped rebuild their populations in the wild. The future of these species looks brighter thanks to you. Well done!

      <EndangeredAnimalsZooOverviewShort>Can you complete the ultimate endangered species challenge? Create a 5-star zoo containing nothing but endangered species! Complete this scenario to unlock the conservation breeding center.
      </EndangeredAnimalsZooOverviewShort>
      <EndangeredAnimalsZooOverview>You've been hired to build a brand new zoo, and the board of directors wants to improve the public's awareness of endangered species. The board has an ambitious plan for you to create a 5-star zoo containing nothing but endangered or critically endangered species!
      <p/>
		The board of directors will allow you to display some non-endangered species as you build your zoo, but to accomplish your goal you must have a 5-star rating and no lower-risk or vulnerable animals in your zoo.
      </EndangeredAnimalsZooOverview>
      <EndangeredAnimalsZooCatchUp>Your zoo is doing well, but the board of directors is concerned that you do not have any endangered or critically endangered species. If you do not obtain at least two different species of endangered or critically endangered animals within the next month, the board will end your employment at the zoo.
      </EndangeredAnimalsZooCatchUp>
      <EndangeredAnimalsZooCatchUpSuccess>You've managed to add two endangered or critically endangered species to your zoo before the board of directors' one-month deadline. The board is pleased with your progress and urges you to acquire more endangered species.
      </EndangeredAnimalsZooCatchUpSuccess>
      <EndangeredAnimalsZooCatchUpFailure>A month has passed and you have failed to acquire two endangered or critically endangered species. The board of directors has removed you from your position because you were not able to create a 5-star zoo that contains only endangered and critically endangered species. Better luck in your future endeavors!
      </EndangeredAnimalsZooCatchUpFailure>      
      
      <EndangeredAnimalsZooForcedAdoption>Your zoo's board of directors has unexpectedly acquired a new endangered species without consulting you! You will find the %s in a crate near the entrance to your zoo. The bad news is that the cost of the animal will be deducted from your funds. The good news is that if you can earn $300 in guest donations for the animal you will become eligible for a hefty grant!
      </EndangeredAnimalsZooForcedAdoption>
     
      <EndangeredAnimalsZooDonationSuccess>You've earned more than $300 in donations for your %s. In recognition of your efforts to expose the public to endangered animals you have received a significant cash grant!
      </EndangeredAnimalsZooDonationSuccess>
      
      <EndangeredAnimalsZooGrant>Your progress in obtaining endangered animals has impressed your zoo's board of directors so much that they have given you a grant!</EndangeredAnimalsZooGrant>
      
      <EndangeredAnimalsZooSuccessOverview>
